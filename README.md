# TypeScript

These are notes on TypeScript I have garnered from my time spent answering Stack Overflow questions, including behavior, canonical issues, workarounds, and anti-patterns.
I often find myself referencing the same documentation and GitHub issues from time to time, so I thought it would be nice if I had them all in one place.
Though I'm far from being a TypeScript expert, I believe these notes are useful for developers of all skill levels.
