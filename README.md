# TypeScript

These are notes on TypeScript I have garnered from my time spent answering Stack Overflow questions, including behavior, canonical issues, workarounds, and anti-patterns.
I often find myself referencing the same documentation and GitHub issues from time to time, so I thought it would be nice if I had them all in one place.
I'm not exactly a TypeScript expert, but these notes should be useful for developers of all skill levels.

All notes are written using the latest version of TypeScript.
